### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practising developing using a mobile first workflow and media queries. It was very helpful in considering and understanding how best to carry out development for a solution that is responsive, by building from the most minimal design outwards.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to practice using media queries and working on how I approach building out designs.
